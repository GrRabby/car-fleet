## 🎨 Design Highlights

### Cockpit Button System

Every primary CTA uses a custom "molded button" pattern with multiple layered effects:

- Outer chrome bezel with hard offset shadow
- Inner red gradient (red-400 → red-700) face
- Glossy top highlight strip
- Hover shine sweep that translates left-to-right
- Active press-down translation (2-3px down)
- Optional red glow shadow underneath

### Telemetry Readouts

Stats and data are displayed as if on a vehicle dashboard:

- Monospace fonts for numbers
- Uppercase tracked labels with `[0.3em]` letter-spacing
- Recessed cell appearance via inset shadows
- Color-coded status indicators (green LED for active, amber for caution, red for alert)
- RPM-style bar indicators

### Racing Stripe System

Thin red gradient stripes at the top of dark sections (navbar, footer) tie the brand visually. Split-pattern (red → black gap → red) creates the iconic dual-stripe muscle car aesthetic.

## 🔐 Authentication Flow

1. User signs up via email/password or Google OAuth (better-auth)
2. better-auth issues an HTTP-only session cookie
3. For API calls, client requests a JWT from `/api/auth/token`
4. JWT is sent as `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header
5. Express backend verifies JWT using better-auth's JWKS endpoint
6. Protected pages use Next.js 16's `proxy.js` to check session on the server before render

---
